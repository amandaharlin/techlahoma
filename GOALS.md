##Purpose
The goal of **Techlahoma** is to raise the awareness of technology in our area and cultivate a positive community effect.

##Metro-contextual
**Techlahoma** isn't OKC-lahoma. It will be started and initially cultivated in OKC, but this is simply for the sake of keeping things simple while we iron initial wrinkles out. In other words, a feature is only officially finished when no one is excluded.

##Exclusive
The core of **Techlahoma** will be open source. The data will not be open (logistical choice and auth token privacy), but an API will exist to supplement that side. If much of the site itself is driven by the API, then the technical choice of rails as the backend isn't a large barrier to entry for people working on the front end (get consensus on that).


##Techlahoma will have 3 major parts.

###Sounding board
**Inspiration = http://lostechies.com/**

- Have a blog roll of local tech bloggers and help promote them on social networks.
- Have a centralized bull horn for things happening. 
-- Think like an entry for a **[Thunder Plains](http://thunderplainsconf.com)** press release injected into the main stream.

###Growth
**inspiration = http://www.madeinok.co/listing**/

I love this notion of company profiles that **[Madeinok](http://www.madeinok.co)** has. However, it doesn't help the dev on the street. 

- Would be nice to tag cloud companies so I can filter by ruby shops or .net shops, node, etc.
- Should also have something to help freelancers/designers/etc.
- Would also really love a "I'm currently a student looking for internships" or "reboot me - change disciplines"
- Local Startups needing users? 
-- For example - **[GoldFire Studios](http://goldfirestudios.com/)** is always needing users for **[CasinoRPG](http://casinorpg.com/)**
- This area should be recruiter safe, but not recruiter run.

###Community
User Group list, calendar, "lunch compiler", "mentor me", User Group Video, etc,  rsvp, reminders who knows what else.

For a group to be listed, it should be an inclusive group and have a code of conduct. For example, Nerd Beers in its current form, wouldn't be eligible.

- Technology fingerprint - skills and interests
- "Where can I learn?" - Local open source projects wanting/needing help
